This Android app is a meticulously crafted quiz application developed entirely using Flutter, a powerful and versatile framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. Harnessing the capabilities of Flutter, this app offers a seamless and immersive user experience on both Android and iOS devices. With its visually appealing interface and smooth animations, the app provides a delightful and intuitive environment for users to engage in challenging quizzes, expand their knowledge, and have fun. 
I am sharing screenshot of one of the question, showing how does the app looks like. Basically we have 12 questions with 2 options each and in scoreboard displayed at the bottom of the app you can check whether your answer is correct or wrong.
